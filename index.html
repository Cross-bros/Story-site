            <h2>General Gist of the Site</h2>
            <div class="one">
            <p style="font-size:large,"><br>This site was made rather sporadically as a silly idea to allow me to store links to the story I am working on and on future stories potentially.<br> <br>
                                            I don't intend to make some super fancy, super amazing and super well designed site, no. I wanted to make something simple.
                                            Keeping it simple allows me to edit it after likely very long breaks between any update. People forget things after all. <br> <br>
                                            Maybe one day I'll have this site looking more professional. Hey, maybe I might even overhaul it completely so that multiple author friends of mine, 
                                            or friends of mine doing other things like coding, engineering, carpentry, etc, can have a page on it, who knows, time will tell.<br> <br>
                                            Until then, I won't say anything silly like "enjoy your stay!" or something along those times, again if anyone this isn't intended for; 
                                            stumbles upon this site, it atleast will be navigable, functional, and at the very least, usuable, then that is enough for me.
