            <p>
                Hey, My name is Luke Munnely O'Reilly, though either surname can be used either independently or together. <br> <br>
                I am a 20 year old College/University student (I went to Institute of Technology Sligo but as of April 2022, it became part of a multi-college program to make multiple colleges around western Ireland into one giant campus for specializing on different fields, aka the Atlantic Technological University, ATU).<br> <br>
                I am currently finished my first year of College in the course "Bachelors in Computers and Science Game Development" level 7. <br> <br>
                I am a beginner at writing stories, a novice artist stuck with traditional forms of art. I like skateboarding, motorsports (G'wan Mclaren F1!), Go-karting, and music.
                I am also fond of the aul pint too, though, give me some credit, it's mostly cider, but otherwise I have a tea addiction. 
                Once I finish college, I intend to relearn Irish, my Gaelic language, as my country of Ireland has a fairly bad education system for teaching it. Which is a shame for such a beautiful language, the language of Saints and Scholars after all.<br> <br>

                Example of my work include:<br><br>

                A concept flag related to the mod: Equestria at War<br><img src="images/Farbrookia-Greneclyf.png" alt="Flag" width="500" height="300"><br><br>
                A Sketch of the Island of Greneclyf from EAW as a mockup for the Cover Image<br><img src="images/Queendom of Greneclyf.jpg" alt="Island" width="300" height="250"><br><br>
                A screenshot of a map I made in Hammer-Map Editor, a oftware used and by Valve for designing maps for IP's such as Teamfortress 2 and Half-Life 2. The map is called CP_Facility<br><img src="images/CP_Facility.jpg">
