                Aillte an Glasa Tí is my first story (and a work in progress). It takes places in an alternative MLP universe known as "Equestria at War" (EAW). Use <a style="color: white;" href="https://equestria-at-war.fandom.com/wiki/Equestria_at_War_Wiki">THIS</a> and <a style="color: white;" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1826643372">THIS</a> for more information<br><br>
                <br>
                The story follows a young unicorn named Fíonn Taistealaí. He's recently finished up his education, and payed his dues. Now he's off to explore the Island of Greneclyf, his home. <br><br>
                He's only ever stuck to one general area of the island for most of his life, the Greater Blosmport Area or GBA. 
                He's never climbed the highest peaks, he's never seen Blomsports contenders for a capital city, he's never visited the vast forests and plains blanketing the island. <br> <br>
                Did I mention that the ponies living here are the minority too? And who you ask is the majority? Changelings of course! Yes, those "love suckers" and "cuddlebugs", or even "boogs". 
                Yeah. Them. Unlike their Equestrian Counterparts, they do not wish to capture or enslave ponies, believe it or not, they welcome ponies and live in harmony with them.<br> <br>
                <br>
                Now this wasn't always the case, indeed once upon a time they were no better than their Equestrian Counterparts. <br><br>
                But that all changed when the Great Hunger occured. Long story short, the ponies of one of the three hillpony nations, Farbrook, offered the changelings love, or a free all you can eat buffet if your a changeling. <br><br>
                From doing this, the Changelings saw the ponies not as enemies, but friends and allies. 
                From there on, both Farbrook and Greneclyf grew close, intertwining themselves among one another, with changelings settling in Farbrook, and ponies in Greneclyf. 
                It's been many many years since then, and ponies and changeling alike have become many generations settled in each nation, adopting their nationalities in the proccess, Farbrookian Changelings, and Greneclyfian Ponies. <br> <br> <br>
                But trouble is brewing on the mainland, far beyond the other Hillponies and their forest and hills. No, this is not some simple and petty trouble. 
                This, this reeks the smell of blood and tears, pride and honour, destruction and glory. There is a war a brewing. And Greneclyf must face it, or be destroyed by it. 
                <br><br>And Fíonn gets a front row seat. <br> <br> <br>
